# Small Projects

Magic Number (python):
orders the numbers 1-9 in a way such the numbers up to each digit place divide by that digit.
(i.e. 3 divides by 1, 38 divides by 2, and 381 divides by 3, so this can be the start of the sequence)

NeuralNet (Jupyter notebook):
Some small, practice neural networks I built so I could understand backpropogation calculus better. These only use numpy functions, not machine learning libraries, so they are not very powerful. I started with examples with one layer and built up to the xor neural net.

Xor Neural Net (python):
An NN that learns the xor bit operation using 2 fully connected layers.
